# Webhook Flow Analysis & Fixes

## Issue Identified
Multiple `CompleteRegistration` webhooks were firing seconds apart due to:

1. **Event Name Mismatch**: Final webhook was incorrectly using `pixel_event_name: 'CompleteRegistration'` instead of `'Lead'`
2. **No Double-Submission Guards**: No protection against rapid clicks or state issues
3. **Inconsistent Event Labeling**: Both webhooks sending same event type to Make.com

## Fixed Webhook Flow

### 1. Initial Submission (Step 5 - After Consent)
- **Endpoint**: `r1kbh1gkk5j31prdnhcn1dq8hsk2gyd9`
- **Event Type**: `CompleteRegistration` âœ…
- **Pixel Event**: `CompleteRegistration` âœ…
- **Purpose**: User gave consent, basic info collected
- **Value**: $12
- **Guard**: `initialSubmitted` state

### 2. Final Submission (Step 10 - All Questions Complete)
- **Endpoint**: `sdv55xk1d8iacpxbhnagymcgrkuf6ju5`
- **Event Type**: `Lead` âœ… (Fixed from `CompleteRegistration`)
- **Pixel Event**: `Lead` âœ… (Fixed from `CompleteRegistration`)
- **Purpose**: Complete lead with all qualifying data
- **Value**: $25
- **Guard**: `finalSubmitted` state

### 3. Abandonment Webhook (3min timer or visibility change)
- **Endpoint**: `sdv55xk1d8iacpxbhnagymcgrkuf6ju5`
- **Event Type**: `FormAbandonment`
- **Purpose**: Partial lead recovery
- **Guard**: `partialSent` state

## Double-Submission Protection Added

```javascript
// State guards
const [initialSubmitted, setInitialSubmitted] = useState(false);
const [finalSubmitted, setFinalSubmitted] = useState(false);

// Check before submission
if (initialSubmitted || isSubmitting) {
  console.log('ðŸš« Initial submission blocked - already submitted or in progress');
  return;
}
```

## Expected Make.com Flow
1. **Initial webhook** â†’ Trigger "CompleteRegistration" automation
2. **Final webhook** â†’ Trigger "Lead" automation (different workflow)
3. **Abandonment webhook** â†’ Trigger "FormAbandonment" automation

This should eliminate duplicate `CompleteRegistration` events and provide clearer funnel tracking.
